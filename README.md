### THE REPOSITORY CONSISTS OF 3 PROGRAMS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS:
    
    PROGRAM ONE:
C program that will take as input a numeric value, a radix, and an operand size. The program will error check for invalid inputs.  Radix values are limited to 8, 10, 16.  Operand size values are limited to bit sizes of 4,8,16.  Numeric input should be in the valid range for the given operand size othewise the program prints an error.  For each input line read consiting of radix,operand size and numerical input; the program returns the the output consiting of value, maximum and minimum of the same. The values that cannot be calculated should show the word Error for a result in the table.  The first four outputs in the table display absolute values, the last three display signed values of the input numerical value which falls within the specific requirement set.
    
    PROGRAM 2:
C program which tests from a set of input values whether a given character code is 
•	lower case
•	upper case
•	digit
•	white space (like null, backspace, space, tabs, etc.)
•	or a special character (like ! or >) in ASCII.  
For each input set value, the program prints the specific Code, Type and ASCII value in the output console.
Input set:  {66,114,117,99,101,32,83,97,121,115,32,72,105,33,7,9,50,48,49,57}

    PROGRAM 3:
C program which performs a set of operations one after the other in series for a given starting integer value 0XCAFE. The operations are done on the output of previous operation. The operations are as follows:
•	Prints the original input in hexadecimal
•	Tests if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and prints the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
•	Reverses the byte order, prints the value in hexadecimal
•	Tests if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and print the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
•	Rotates the value by four bits to the left, prints the value in hexadecimal
•	Tests if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and prints the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
•	Rotates the value by eight bits to the right, prints the value in hexadecimal
•	Tests if 3 of last 4 bits are on, and prints the value in binary (along with the result of the test – true/false)
The results of each operation is displayed as output as mentioned in the following instructions.
